# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms – Personal Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal projects where I’ve explored and implemented various **data structures and algorithms**. The goal is to strengthen my understanding through practical applications and problem-solving.

## 🧱 Structures Used

- **Stacks & Queues** – Simulated workflows, basic operations, and linear problem-solving.
- **Trees** – Implementations of binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees for balanced storage and search functionality.
- **Other Structures** – Exploration of graphs, heaps, and hash maps (in progress).

## 🧠 Algorithms

Includes common sorting and searching algorithms, as well as recursive and traversal-based problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

- **C++**
- Occasional use of testing frameworks and simple visualizations

## 🎯 Purpose

This is an evolving space for building, testing, and refining my grasp of fundamental CS concepts in preparation for real-world development and technical interviews.
